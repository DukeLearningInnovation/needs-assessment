# Criteria collection and classification

Our criteria have evolved over time. Our initial set of criteria was drawn from a previous platform comparison set of use cases, our own use cases after implementing the Open edX platform, and additional new ideas for use cases based on potential or desired projects that had not yet been initiated. Our Duke Extend service team reviewed this list of criteria and gave each a +1/0/-1 vote. That list is in Google Drive:  https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Efgz2Ym4mH0VjPFme6sedj2eyDtl8nSCHFUb1xoYJ6s/edit?usp=sharing

Each use case begins with “We’re looking for a platform(s) that allows the university to...”

1. Deliver courses over a variety of modalities to mixed audiences at traditional and large scales.
2. Offer training and assessment in basic technical skills to Duke affiliates and the public. 
3. Partner with other universities to deliver the same course to all students at once in one learning space. 
4. Show student progress to individual learners.++
5. Allow experimentation and demonstration of the capabilities of the platform.
6. Add traditional and large scale, mixed audiences to specific modules/features/tools of a course. 
7. Scale to incorporate up to 10,000 learners in a single course.
8. Add traditional and large scale, mixed audiences to an entire course regardless of original audience and without the need for prior student enrollment or account creation.

	4. certification, 
	5. eligible learner population, and
	6. frequency and nature of platform updates.
38. Tailor flow control of student experience through the course (adaptive learning)

After further review and discussion, this list was consolidated into new criteria with fewer overlaps between features, listed below. These criteria were written on cards, one criterion per card, and shared with several staff in Learning Innovation to gain their perspectives about the importance of each. Participants were asked to identify critical criteria or non-essential criteria; all remaining criteria were considered as 'differentiating'. After eight participants contributed their input, the criteria were ranked and classified. Upvotes were based on a participant identifying a criterion as 'critical' and downvotes were based on a participant identifying a criterion as 'unnecessary' or 'non-essential'. After the exercise, participants were each asked two questions. What guiding principles did you rely on to make your classifications? What, if any, additional criteria would you suggest we consider for this platform comparison?
